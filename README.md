# Hide and Squeak
## Robotic mouse feeder toy for cats

Currently only a software implementation, with MS Paint mock-ups of proposed structural design.

Current code requires Arduino 101, two buttons, and access to the Serial monitor. Has some framework for adding the wheel stepper motors and the kibble dispenser servo motor. No current design for the kibble pinwheel.
